                <p>
                  I'm a keen software engineer/computer scientist, having just finished my MSci in Glasgow, now starting a PhD at Imperial College London, and very interested in all things related to operating systems, wireless sensor networks, embedded/contrained devices, robotics, vehicular ad-hoc networks, distributed systems and many others.
                </p> 
                <p>
                  I also like learning languages, such as French and Japanese (also dabbled in Italian, German, Cantonese).
                </p>
                
                <h4>Projects</h4>
                <p>
                  I love working on projects, especially ones involving electronics, code and physical bits and bobs. During my last 2 years of Uni, I've worked on two significant self-defined projects, which involved creating a secure and integrated Intranet of Things protocol and suite of tools to support it.

              <h4>Work</h4>
              <p>
                I've been lucky enough to work for two great companies, Fujitsu and JP Morgan, whilst studying for my degree. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I worked at the Fujitsu's Human Centric Robotics Lab in Atsugi, Japan and got to experience an amazing country for three months. Whilst there I got to meet some great and very friendly people, enjoyed the wonderful weather (lovely sun, oh and a typhoon, earthquake and many sweaty commutes), worked with a fantastic team on an very cool teddy bear robotics project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwWeN1ARy74" target="_blank">check him out here</a>. <a href="http://fergusleahy.wordpress.com" target="_blank">I also wrote a little blog about my trip here.</a>
              </p>
              
              <h4>Play</h4>
              <p>
                I have more interests than I often care to admit, including kite flying, tinkering with electronics, programming, film (especially HK cinema), games, most things Japanese and more recently skiing and model trains.
