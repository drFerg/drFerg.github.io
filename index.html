          <h4>About</h4>
          <p>I'm a 5th year MSci Software Engineering student studying at the University of Glasgow.</p>

          <h4>Play</h4>
          <p>I have more interests that I often care to admit, including kite flying, tinkering with electronics, programming, film (especially HK cinema), games, most things Japanese and more recently skiing and model trains.</p>
          <h4>Projects</h4>
          <p> I love working on projects, especially ones involving electronics, code and physical do-dads. During my last 2 years of Uni, I've worked on two significant self-defined projects, which involved creating a secure and integrated Intranet of Things protocol and suite of tools.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4>Work</h4>
          <p> I've been lucky enough to work for two great companies, Fujitsu and JP Morgan, whilst studying for my degree. </p>
          <p>
            I worked at the Fujitsu's Human Centric Robotics Lab in Atsugi, Japan and got to experience an amazing country for three months. Whilst there I got to meet some great and very friendly people, enjoyed the wonderful weather (lovely sun, oh and a typhoon, earthquake and many sweaty commutes), worked with a fantastic team on an interesting teddy bear robotics project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwWeN1ARy74">check him out here</a>.</p>

          <h4>Learn</h4>
          <p>I'm a keen software engineer/computer scientist, currently finishing my MSci in Glasgow, and very interested in all things related to operating systems, wireless sensor networks, embedded/contrained devices, vehicular ad-hoc networks, distributed systems and many others.</p> <p>I'm also like learning languages, such as French and Japanese, though I'm not great at it (also dabbled in Italian, German, Cantonese).</p>
