      <description>Ever wanted to know if you needed to run to catch that bus or train&amp;hellip;no, well I did!
A simple ambient display to show bus and train times for a local stop, with weather info to let you know if you need an jacket on the way out.
Uses a kindle display to non-intrusively show info and looks great on its non-backlit e-paper display.
Written in Python utilising the MetOffice and TfL open data APIs to grab weather and transport information, respectively.</description>

      <description>An android mobile app for alerting sleepy passengers of their impending stop. Built after I grew tired of falling asleep and missing my stop on the way home from a long day (excuse the pun :D).
The app monitors WiFi access-points available on London underground station platforms, recording a user&amp;rsquo;s progress towards their target location, i.e., home. As they approach their station the phone alerts the user in the hope they will wake up and realise.</description>
