      <description>Ever wanted to know if you needed to run to catch that bus or train&amp;hellip;no, well I did!
A simple ambient display to show bus and train times for a local stop, with weather info to let you know if you need an jacket on the way out.
Uses a kindle display to non-intrusively show info and looks great on its non-backlit e-paper display.
Written in Python utilising the MetOffice and TfL open data APIs to grab weather and transport information, respectively.</description>

      <description>During my internship in Fujitsu Laboratories Japan, I worked on their human-centric robotics project involving a bear robot. The bear was designed and built to support young and elderly care, providing eduction and play for children, and human like care-support for Japan&amp;rsquo;s aging population.
My project had me learn the bear&amp;rsquo;s hardware and software architecture, iteratively develop a user-friendly application controlling the bear, and carrying out and evaluating a set of psychology experiments to understand human perception of the bear.</description>
