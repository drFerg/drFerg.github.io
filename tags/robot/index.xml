      <description>During my internship in Fujitsu Laboratories Japan, I worked on their human-centric robotics project involving a bear robot. The bear was designed and built to support young and elderly care, providing eduction and play for children, and human like care-support for Japan&amp;rsquo;s aging population.
My project had me learn the bear&amp;rsquo;s hardware and software architecture, iteratively develop a user-friendly application controlling the bear, and carrying out and evaluating a set of psychology experiments to understand human perception of the bear.</description>
